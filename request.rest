  "answer": "One particularly challenging technical problem I faced was a performance bottleneck in a Node.js application that used PostgreSQL. The API was experiencing high latency spikes during peak hours, but the server and database CPU usage were normal. After some investigation, I discovered the issue was related to database connection pooling. The application was creating a new connection for almost every single request instead of reusing existing ones, which was causing significant overhead. To diagnose this, I used PostgreSQL's pg_stat_activity view to monitor connection counts and identify the pattern. The solution involved implementing a proper connection pool with pg-pool and configuring it to maintain a minimum number of idle connections. This change significantly improved the application's performance and stability under heavy load."
